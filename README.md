# GoWander - Personal Project

The brief is to create a travel application for those with wanderlust. 
An application that has UX and UI suitable for both those are and arenâ€™t good with technology. 


The concept of GoWonder, is a simple way to explore a city. You simply type in your location, add a filter here and there, press the button, and it will generate an activity for you to do based on your filters and preferences.

For this project the website only focuses on Birmingham UK.
